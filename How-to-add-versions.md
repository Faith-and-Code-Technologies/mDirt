# How to Add New mDirt Modules
**As of mDirt v3.0**

- Use `lib/PYs/compile_data.py` to compile the new data json. Upload it to `lib/` in the Github
- Update `lib/version_list.json` to include the new version, and upload it to the Github
- Create a new module (i.e. `v1_22_0`) and upload it to the Github

### And that's it!
I streamlined the update process so the app itself does not need to be updated!
