## Coming Soon
- Custom Components for Custom Items:
  - To do this, I have to create a way to dynamically generate widgets easily without thousands of lines of boilerplate.
- Custom Enchantments:
  - This will not happen until after I create the system mentioned above.

## In Progress
- MacOS native binary (@JustJoshinDev)

### Known Issues
The UI is broken if you run the code on MacOS. *This is being worked on* (@JustJoshinDev)

## Credits
The tool was made entirely by me, with lots of help from @JustJoshinDev.
Some Datapack things, such as the method for creating custom blocks, was developed by others:
